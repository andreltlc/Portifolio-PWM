        <p class="introduction">Here you will find out a little about me, professionally. Feel free to browse and explore a little about Who am I.  
            If that's not feel enough, please get in Contact, literally, if you don't got the joke, please read it again. 
            If you left the loop, I'll be more direct and ask you to go to the projects page, 
            to find out a little more about what I done. 
            If in any way I was interesting to you, or my work interested you, don't forget that I have a keyboard button right above, just for you to get in Contact. 
            Also, feel free to download my resume and analyze it better.</p>
