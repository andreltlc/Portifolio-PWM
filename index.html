            If you left the loop, I'll be more direct and ask you to go to the projects page, 
            to find out a little more about what I done. 
            If in any way I was interesting to you, or my work interested you, don't forget that I have a keyboard button right above, just for you to get in Contact. 
            Also, feel free to download my resume and analyze it better.</p>
